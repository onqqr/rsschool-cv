### Briefly About Myself

I started my career as a process plant operator at the Mozyr Oil Refinery, which allowed me to gain experience in working with a team and achieving assigned tasks.

After 5 years of main work, my interest in realizing myself in something else led me to Poland, where I was able to work in other professions. Thanks to a year of living in another country, I developed my horizons and insight into digital technologies.

Having a huge community, free materials, prospects for career growth and self-education, I decided to return back and devote all my free time to learning front-end development.

I hope that my acquired experience and ability to self-learn will help me become a front-end developer.
